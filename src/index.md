## So who are we?

We're Angela and Stetson. Together we've built both a residential painting company called [Great Plains Painting](https://greatplainspaintingkc.com) and a holiday lighting company called [Tis the Season Holiday Lighting](https://tistheseasonkc.com). We use the very same tools we'll help you with in those businesses to:

1. Not forget important things (computers are great at not forgetting things)
2. Delight our customers with our responsiveness and accuracy
3. Free up our time so that we can focus on what's next or have a little fun and not work ALL THE TIME

We're on the west coast of the USA in Santa Barbara, CA (Pacific Time Zone) and we'd love to talk to you.
